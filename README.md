Personalized To Do list - automatically rolls incomplete tasks over to the next day.

## User Story
As a person who has trouble keeping track of the things I'd like to do each day, both large and small, when I open the app:
* I am presented with a simplified view of today's tasks
* Any tasks I did not complete yesterday are rolled over to today's list, beginning at the top
* I can remove tasks easily by dragging them to the trash
* I can add new tasks for the day
* I can add tasks to future dates
* I am alerted if tasks have rolled over for 3 or more days
